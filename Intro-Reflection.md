# CDM-Visual-Argument
For my project I aimed to create a visual argument centered around the debate between public transportation and private transportation as cars. In the United States we see both sides of this issue, with some cities investing in a comprehensive public transportation system and others opting to neglect it completely in favor of a car-dependent system. After doing a bit of traveling, I was struck by just how inefficient a car-reliant system truly is and how it negatively impacts both the fabric of a society and the society's efficiency as a whole. Growing up in DC, I decided to use the metro system after a Nationals game to highlight both the community aspect creatd by a train system and the sheer amount of people that can be moved by 1 train. I then added text to highlight these efficiencies, warping it to fit the wall of the station and create a more seamless experience for the viewer. I then used contrast by showing a picture of heavy traffic at night. This not only creates the visual contrast of dark vs. light, but a conceptual contrast of how spacially inefficient the cars are and the isolation created by needing a car. I added text in the same pattern as the metro picture to further highlight the stark differences. I imagine most viewers would be drawn to the brighter top frame highlighting the metro then work their eyes down to the image of heavy traffic, accentuating the glaring differences.
